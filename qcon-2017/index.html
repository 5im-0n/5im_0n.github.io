<li>more keywords: drive change, innovation, diversity and equality in the workplace</li>
<li>waterfall is absolutely dead: agile/scrum is what it is since 2008. since 2012 it&#39;s about scaling agile and scrum.</li>
<li>soap is absolutely dead. nobody even mentioned it. rest/swagger is what it is.</li>

<p><img src="qcon-2017/bbc/DSC_0555.JPG" alt=""><br>team workflow is now better: everyone can focus just on the piece that concerns them.<br>tdd development with pairing. there is a test for almost everything, and everyone has a backup. no one person owns a service anymore. the team owns all of the services.<br>problems faced: redis was a central point of everything, so there was no confidence in changing something that involved redis. solution: abstract redis with an api, and use multiple redis databases, one for episodes, one for shared stuff, ...<br>use yeoman to automate the creation of the small apps. this reduced the ammount of configuration essentially to 0.<br>seyren to check/monitor services.<br><img src="qcon-2017/bbc/DSC_0556.JPG" alt=""><br>everything over https and keep-alive internally.<br>deleting the shared database: we checked if something writes or reads from it. but there was some obscure software that was reading and writing to it every 40 minutes... deplyed a fix for it.<br>every piece of software now has it&#39;s own db, and is autonomous.<br>everything is consistent with node and js on the frontend. no context switching.<br><img src="qcon-2017/bbc/DSC_0557.JPG" alt=""><br>the team is just 4 people, with no pm.<br>consumer contracts help a lot with independence between client and api services.<br>moving from redis to postgres for some service because the requirements become more complex. redis is just a store, postgres can have complex sql reports.<br><img src="qcon-2017/bbc/DSC_0558.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>would be nice to have in our infra!</p>
<p>why serverless?</p>
<ul>
<li>ops: <del>#noops</del></li>
<li>#lessops</li>
<li>benchmarks</li>
<li>fallbacks</li>
<li>load testing</li>
<li>monitornig</li>
<li>scaling: up AND down</li>
<li>single function deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>vendor lockin? yes, it is a problem. serverless framework tries to abstract that away, hopfully we will get there.  </p>
<p>granularity on functions as a service compared to microservices: you can do microservices with faas.</p>

<p>innovation is really important for uber, the team has to enable it.</p>

<p>you go there, and work on your idea for a week/10 days, and then you come back.<br>&quot;find the perfect match both in terms of skill and cultural fit&quot;<br>...<br>we hire great people, and we need to empower them and keep them motivated, and blabla...  </p>
<p>it&#39;s ok to fail. postmortems are really important because we want to understand what went wrong.  </p>

<p>once upon a time, when there was a new release, on the lunch break everybody logged on and tested the app.<br>now we use tools to do it, and run it as part of jenkins or our ci.<br>keep the numbers, so we see how the speed changes over time. if there are regressions we can handle them.  </p>
<p>different types of benchmarks and when they make sense:<br><img src="qcon-2017/cpt/DSC_0576.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/cpt/DSC_0577.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/cpt/DSC_0578.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>so async or sync? all we want is the simplicity of sync to reason about the code, but the efficiency of asncronicity: do something while we wait.<br>talk goes on on how to handle async code, but in the end async is just a different paradigm:</p>
<ul>
<li>callbacks, <code>async</code>, ...</li>
<li>handle errors like events</li>
</ul>

<p>skybet had a php app that was really convulted and made of bad code, but it worked and was used a lot.<br><img src="qcon-2017/monolyths/DSC_0584.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/monolyths/DSC_0585.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/monolyths/DSC_0587.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/monolyths/DSC_0588.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/monolyths/DSC_0589.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/monolyths/DSC_0590.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>they needed to implement some things that could not be done with the old architecture (live updates, be fast, ...), so they choose a new architecture based on the same old js -&gt; api -&gt; db, and started to refactor pieces of the old app, until most of the old app was made using the new tech (openkat!).</p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/monolyths/DSC_0591.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>with react they could partially do that.</p>

<p><img src="qcon-2017/spotify/DSC_0599.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/spotify/DSC_0600.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>two main parts: the client and the ad server.  </p>
<p>the ad server had to be refactored because</p>
<ul>
<li>it had logic in the client</li>
<li>did not scale</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/spotify/DSC_0601.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>how? keep the existing api so the change is transparent for the client.<br>took about 18 months.  </p>
<p>in the second stage the client was replaced.<br>it was a big monolyth that was refactored into services.  </p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/spotify/DSC_0602.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>so the logic was independent and we could change things without breaking completely unrelated things.  </p>

<p>1.23 billio access facebook every day.<br>we have to make sure there people get the best experience possible<br>facebook live is used to share moments with followers as they are happening.<br>everything started at a hackaton in april 2015. a hackaton at facebook is an short event where some people come together and do something. people are asked not to do work related things during hackathons.<br>a few months later afeter the hackathon &quot;mentions&quot; launched in august 2015. in december 2015 &quot;users&quot; launched.<br>so from 0 to production in 8 months. and everything we launch has to scale to 1 billion users.  </p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/facebook/DSC_0607.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>there are local pops where users connect, and pops send data between them on big pipes.<br>facebook live is different from other video platforms, because</p>
<ul>
<li>the videos are created in real time and can thus not be cached</li>
<li>we do not know what video becomes most pupular</li>
</ul>
<p>we want to go from 0 to production in 4 months and to all users in 8 months.</p>

<p>broadcast client -&gt; pop -&gt; datacenter<br>the pop has scriptable logic: for example it can decide on wich datacenter to store the video based on load balancing logic.  </p>
<p>complicated logic with video ids to handle cell phone disconnections and datacenter encoders downtime.  </p>
<p>low bandwith has to be handled with adaptive bitrate and buffering on the client.<br><img src="qcon-2017/facebook/DSC_0610.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>apps in containers are stateless, but databases and filesystems sometimes need state.</p>
<p>traditional (broken) development model<br><img src="qcon-2017/containers-state/DSC_0624.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>broken because once stuff lands in production it breaks in subtle ways - fixed with containers.</p>
<p>so how do we keep state with containers?<br>using the cloud is not a great idea, because if you are going to become vendor dependent just buy in on that vendor and use them for everything.<br><img src="qcon-2017/containers-state/DSC_0625.JPG" alt=""><br><img src="qcon-2017/containers-state/DSC_0626.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>two ways to map persistent storage:<br>network attached: use a network fs like ciph<br>local attached: docker has <code>--volumes-from</code> to use containers that contain only storage to use for database containers.  </p>

<p>but people don&#39;t understand it.<br>cultural changes are hard. at netflix if you deploy it you own it.<br>if you try to bring change in the company, think of you as someone who can not do this by yourself, nobody listens to you, you don&#39;t have the influence.  </p>
<ul>
<li>choose allies</li>
<li>build the right team (take the people that read hacker news, that look at now technologies, that go to conferences, ...)</li>
<li>choose the right project</li>
<li>small iterations</li>
<li>embrace failure (the project may fail, but you will see what went wrong, iterate)</li>
<li>be ready for inception (people don&#39;t like change, but when they see git push and brrrr they will come)</li>
<li>seek professional help (the idea is that you are going to be the baseline for the company, so if you start with a bad example, people will follow that, because they don&#39;t know. so try to make it right.)</li>

<p>knowing when there is a problem is not enough. What you want is get a notification when you need to act. everything else is just noise.</p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0643.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>monitoring microservices is very different than monitoring a monolyth. monitoring is harder because you have a lot more services.</p>
<ol>
<li>build a system that you can support.  </li>
</ol>
<p>basic tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>logging with log aggregation</li>
<li>monitoring (we use nagios - financial times)</li>
</ul>
<p>only get an alert when we lose all services in the cluster. if one goes down, who cares as long as the system is up.<br>we had a very bad idea: make the monitoring screens shift automatically from page 1 -&gt; 2 and it was never on the page we needed.<br><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0644.JPG" alt=""><br>a click takes you to more detail</p>
<p>to graph stuff we use graphite -&gt; grafana</p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0645.JPG" alt=""><br>we need to understand how to map the service requests to an http request, so we intoduced <code>transaction_ids</code>. made a java servlet filter so it&#39;s easy to integrate. so if you want to debug something, and know the transaction id, you can see all the services involved.</p>
<ol>
<li>concentrate on the stuff that matters</li>
</ol>
<p>if the first attempt failed, but the second got through, i don&#39;t really care about the first failure, because basically the thing worked. monitor the business services</p>
<ol>
<li>cultivate your alerts</li>
</ol>
<p>make sure each alert is great!</p>
<p>bad:<br><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0646.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>good:<br><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0647.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>make sure alerts can&#39;t be missed.<br>use the right comunication channels.  </p>
<p>support isn&#39;t just getting the system fixed: we need all to know what happened, how it was fixed, ...<br><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0649.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0650.JPG" alt=""><br>this is important because otherwise people build stuff that breaks.</p>
<p>if you did&#39;nt get an alert, and things did go wrong, something is wrong. you need to fix it. setting up an alert is part of fixing the problem.</p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/alerts/DSC_0651.JPG" alt=""><br>you need to make sure that if things break, stuff still works and alerts work. so break things.  </p>

<p>speaker implements (live!) a reactive api.<br>at the end she says &quot;so now, it does exactly the same thing as before, but with slightly more code.&quot;</p>
<p>more demos of java 9 features</p>
<ul>
<li>streams api</li>
<li>collections convenience methods</li>
<li>additions to interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>takeaway points from the speaker: don&#39;t jigsaw jour app just jet. it&#39;s too early.</p>

<p><img src="qcon-2017/monitoring/DSC_0661.JPG" alt=""><br>&quot;sure! what went wrong? can i se the error?&quot;<br>&quot;we don&#39;t know&quot;<br>&quot;can i see the logs?&quot;<br>&quot;yeah, but you need to talk to the ops&quot;<br>and after a few hours you look like this<br><img src="qcon-2017/monitoring/DSC_0662.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>so why go serverless?</p>
<ul>
<li>it&#39;s more secure</li>
<li>it scales up and down</li>
<li>you don&#39;t need infrasructure on your own</li>
<li>operations: there is a lot of talk about devops, ops, .. in the end it does not matter. you want the services to be up, and serverless gives you that</li>
</ul>
<p>serverless building blocks</p>
<ul>
<li>aws lamda</li>
<li>aws api gateway</li>
<li>aws dynamodb</li>
<li>aws kinesis streams (pub-sub)</li>
<li>lots more ...</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/monitoring/DSC_0663.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>with cloudwatch you can monitor almost anything in all services you use.</p>
<ul>
<li>logging</li>
<li>events</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/monitoring/DSC_0664.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>health checks: route53<br>tracing: aws x-ray<br>auditing: aws cludtrail</p>
<p><strong>the future</strong>: we are in the early stages, but we are headed to total visibility and observability. monitoring is becoming a comodity: it&#39;s just one more of the services.</p>

<p>put data in the cloud without losing control.</p>
<p><img src="qcon-2017/storage/DSC_0668.JPG" alt=""></p>
<p>save the data on hosts that gain money if they store your data with blockchain smart contracts.</p>
<p>ok it&#39;s late.. time to go home.</p>
